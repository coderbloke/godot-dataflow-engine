# godot-dataflow-engine
 
_Nothing special here yet.<br>
Just checked in for reporting Godotengine issues._

The project itself could turn into a easy and fancy dataflow solution for Godot.
But currently rather the end of a rabbit hole:
- I played around OpenStreetMap in Godot here: https://github.com/coderbloke/godot-osm
- When during this I started to get lost in a multi-level nested inpectors, I started this: https://github.com/coderbloke/godot-inspector-architect
- From this I extracted a part of it as a lightweight script code generator: https://github.com/coderbloke/godot-code-generator
- With this I am a point, where I'm devel√©poing the possibility to set the code generation automated within any project.<br>
  This can have multiple use case, which diffrs from each other.<br>
  When I was thinking, what use case exist, I realized it would be good to have a more general light weight build system, in which code generation would only ba a job.
- Then I realized a buld system can be described with a general dataflow system, if you have the right dataflow functions for generation for example.

Never mind. Now I'm here, and the above projects are pedngin a bit.
